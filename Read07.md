# All about Javascript & jQuery

We will go over how JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly jQuery is a tool that makes  writing JavaScript a lot easier.

 As we were taught previously, we need to know how to build web pages using HTML and CSS before stepping into the javaScript era. Learning to program with JavaScript involves 3 steps:

1. Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.

2. Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.

3. Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking getting to know how other's have built their websites, and what their Javascript coding looks like.

Javascript's main component is to make the website created interactive. To do such thing, it goes through a specific process;

1. Accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.

2. Modifying content, by adding or removing elements, attributes, or text.

3. Programming rules by specifying a set of steps for the the browser to follow.

4. The reaction to the events, by running a script when a command has occured, such as links, buttons, cursor and so on.

## Baby steps of Programming

Before stepping into the language it self, there are some key concepts that one needs to become familiar with;

A. What is a script and how do i create one?
B. How do computers read them?
C. How do I write a script for a web page?

### A. SCRIPT

A script is basically made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step. A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user is using your web page.

Writing a skill involves the following;

1. You must first state a goal followed by the tasks that need to be done in order to achieve it/run it.

2. Design the script by seperating the goals into a series of tasks

3. Then write each of the steps in a programming language so the computer can read it and implement it.

### Vocabulary vs Syntax

Vocabulary are the words that the computer understands, virsus the syntax which is how to put these words in instructions so that the computer can follow.

## Naming Variables

There are six rules one must follow when giving a variable a name:

1. Name must begin with a letter or $ or an underscore. I cannot start with a number.

2. The name can contain letters, numbers, ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name, as they are for something else.

3. *Keywords* are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable.

4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names.

5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fname might be used to store a person's first name, lname for their last name.

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. Example, fName and lName.

**Arrays** are a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.An array should be considered whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.

**Expressions** In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).
var color = 'beige'; The value of co1or is now beige.

 Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:

- Functions & Methods:

 Functions consist of a series of statements
that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task.

- Objects & Built-in objects
