# How do computers work

## What makes a computer functioning

Throughout the years, we have always built tools in order to solve problems. Back in the days, these tools were were help for the manual labor, such as;

- a wheele barrel.

As years passed on, machine were invented in order to solve thinking labor, such as;

- solving equations.

In order to create a thinking machine, 4 tasks were needed to be done:

1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

All 4 mentioned aspects are found in common in **ALL** computers.

### 1. Input

The input takes what the user is currently doing on the computer (scrolling, clicking, etc)

### 2. Storage & Processing

All the inputs are then stored in the memory (which is the storage). Then the computer's processor takes the information from the memory and manipulates it using *algorithms* into series of commands, then sends the information back to the stored memory again.

### 3. Output

How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer's designed to do.

A computer display can show:

- text
- photos
- videos

## Hardware & Software

The hardware is the combination of different elemts inside a computer;

- circuits
- speakers
- wires
- chips

and the list goes on. And what we don't see, falls into the software category;

- example:  web pages.
The software in other words is what we do not see in a computer.

### How do hardwares and softwares interact with one another

### 1. CPU

The central processing unit (CPU) is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. It needs to do different things,so for this reason it has a wide range of simpler parts that handle specific tasks.

It contains:

- circuit to handle math and logic
- circuits to send information to and from different parts of the computer

### 2. Binary Code

The binary code is the most basic form of software and controls all the hardware of a computer. (Programing Languages)

## Circuits & Logic

Circuits can sometimes be seen as art. Any creative idea in mind can be turned into a circuit.

Circuits are mini electronic components joined together.

*Simple circuit* take an electronic signal and then flip it this means if signla is 1, circtuit gives you a 0 and vis versa.
*complicated circuit* can take multiple signals and combine them, thus giving you a different result.  For this example, a circuit would take 2 electrical signals (same or different), the results will still be a 0, unless both are 1 and 1.
