## Process & Design

For this segment, we will be covering 3 major topics;

1. Building a site
2. Understanding your audience and their needs
3. How to present your information in an aesthically pleasing way

### 1. Building a site

Asking questions is essential in order to gather up ideas and brainstorm to have a better mindset before entering the process and design of your site.
The following are types of questions that will help guide through your path;

- How to organize information that will be easy for your site visitors?
- What theme and layout should I use that will be visually comfortable for the audience?
- What are designs tips that I am not familiar with to gain my creativity?

### 2. My audience & their needs

Note that your site will only be catered to your audience's needs and wants and nothing else.

How can I get to know my audience?

Brainstorming and writing key words is very important when it comes to design. You will have to create design solutions that will make the audience's experience enjoyable and desirable.

Is your audience:

- individuals
- companies

Writing down questions to understand a bit more deeply about your audience will also help you want pin point who they are;

- What are their ages?
- Where do they live?
- Marital status?
- Are they familiar with the web?
- How often do they use the web?

There are numerous questions to be asked, the more questions the narrower is your focal point. A survey might be a great help to widen your results.

Name | Gordon | Molly | Jasper | Ayo | Ivy |
-----|--------|-------|--------|-----|------
Gender | M | F | M | M | F
Age |  28 | 47 | 19 | 32 | 35

After understanding who your target audience really is, you can go deeper into understanding what they want and don't want, like and dislike about the web.

### 3. Design of your site

The design is so important that even if the content was not relevant, the design of the site can make your audience think it is.

#### Site Maps

Site maping is basically sketching out the layout of your site. You can think of it as the skeleton body of your future site.

#### Wireframes

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

You will need to set the hierarchy of your content, by selecting the priorities, then organizing them

The hierarchy is achieved by focusing on the following aspects:

- Size:
Larger elements will grab users' attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large.
- Color:
Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.
- Style:
An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out.
- Visual:
Refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.
- Grouping:
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

A consitency in a design is very important in order to keep the design and typography visually presentable.
