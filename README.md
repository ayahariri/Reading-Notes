# ALL ABOUT MASTERING MARKDOWN

## What is a Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style your content on a web. You control the display of your content by formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists and so much more! In other words, designing the content you want your reader to read, and design it in a way that is pleasurable to read. 

## Syntax Guide to Markdown

There are several ways for your to display your content. 

### A. Headers 
Headers are very important for your reader to understand the hierarchy of your notes. 
Headers go from 1# to 6# depending on the importance/size of your title (1# being the highest).

### B. Styling of your text
There are many ways to style your text with markdown. 
1. Creating your font in **bold**, you will need to add ** at the front and at the end of your word or sentence **. 
2. Creating your font in *italic*, requires putting * at the front and at the end of your word/sentence *
3. Creating a crossed out word/sentence such as ~FIXED MINDSET~, you will have to add a ~ at the front and at the end of your word/sentence ~

## The Do's and Don't 

There are certain criterias that will help or harm you in trying to adapt the growth mindest; such as
Don't | Do's
------|--------
avoiding challenges | embracing challenges
ignoring criticism | learning from harsh criticism
being threatened by the success of others | getting inspired by other's success

All in all, it is having a positive mindest into whatever challenges, obstacles that come up your way. Wanting and understanding that you can expand your learning capabilities. Wanting to grow in all aspects of your learning pathway, with the success and failure that come in between.
