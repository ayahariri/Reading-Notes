# ALL ABOUT MASTERING MARKDOWN

## What is a Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style your content on a web. You control the display of your content by formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists and so much more! In other words, designing the content you want your reader to read, and design it in a way that is pleasurable to read. 

## Syntax Guide to Markdown

There are several ways for your to display your content. 

### A. Headers 

Headers are very important for your reader to understand the hierarchy of your notes. 
Headers go from 1# to 6# depending on the importance/size of your title (1# being the highest).

### B. Styling of your text

There are many ways to style your text with markdown. 
1. Creating your font in **bold**, you will need to add ** at the front and at the end of your word or sentence **. 
2. Creating your font in *italic*, requires putting * at the front and at the end of your word/sentence *
3. Creating a crossed out word/sentence such as ~FIXED MINDSET~, you will have to add a ~ at the front and at the end of your word/sentence ~
4. Emphasizing your text, will only require you to add _**bold**_, so adding a _ at the front and at the end of your word/sentence _ even if the bold or italic styling was on.

### C. Listings and Tables

Organizing your information is very essential in order for your content to feel legible. 
You can showcase your content through listings (ordered or unordered) such as the following: 

Best countries to visit during the summertime: (ordered list)
1. Maldives
2. Bora Bora
3. Thailand 

Best countries to visit during the summertime: (unordered list)
- Maldives
- Bora Bora
- Thailand
You need to make sure you put a space after the number or dash.
In conclusion, ordered list you will have to type in a number or letter followed by a dot, then a space. An unordered list you will have to type in star or dash followed by a space.

Tables are also a fun way to display your information or comparison for a specific topic, I will use the example above by using this criteria:
Summertime Countries | Winter Countries
------------ | -------------
Bora Bora | Canada
Maldives | Russia


### D. Images/Links

Adding images is very important in bringing your web page to life, by adding hints of color as well as visuals for your readers.

 Links will help your reader go from one page to a specific page where they would get more information depending on the context, for this example I will link a website for the best resorts in Bora Bora

 ### E. Quote
 
 If you'd like to quote someone, you must first put the > character before the line:

> Bora Bora. One of the most magical places I've visited.
> - Collin Holloway

### F. Listings
Listings are a fun way to create task lists, reminders and so on. For example, before I travel, I need to make sure I pack all the following:
- [x] Passport
- [x] Toothbrush & Toothpaste
- [x] Clothing
- [ ] Shoes

### G. Mentions

Linking or mentioning people is an easy way to direct a comment at someone, by simply using the "@" followed by their name. Example: Hey @travelblogger — enjoy your summer vacation!

## GROWTH MINDEST

A growth mindest in summary is basically the way one thinks about his capabilities in learning and expanding his knowledge. 
There are two mindsets: 
1. Fixed mindset
2. Growth mindset 

The image below showcases the differences between both mindsets

## The Do's and Don't 

There are certain criterias that will help or harm you in trying to adapt the growth mindest; such as

Don't | Do's
------|--------
~avoiding challenges~ | embracing challenges
~ignoring criticism~ | learning from harsh criticism
~being threatened by the success of others~ | getting inspired by other's success

The Don't column are behavioral patterns that should be avoided and replaced with the Do's

### Summary of Growth Mindset

All in all, growth mindset is implementing a positive mindest into whatever challenge, obstacle, criticism that you face during your process. It is also wanting and understanding that you can expand your learning capabilities. Wanting to grow in all aspects of your learning pathway, with the success and failure that come in between. Failure should never be taken granted of or ignored,

> "Don’t worry about failure. Worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try."
> -Sherman Finesilver

Asking yourself questions through the process is also an important key to keep yourself motivated and on the right path. Questions may vary depending on the obstacle or challenge that you are facing. 
For example, if someone has given me harsh criticism, instead of letting it be a negative comment, I ask myself:
1. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
2. How can I avoid such criticism in the future?
I can also add positive comments to my criticism:
3. What part am I most proud of?
4. What has the criticism taught me?
